Hi! I'm Xiaoyin, welcome to my personal website.

I'm a second-year master student at Duke University, advised by Prof. [Sam Wiseman](https://swiseman.github.io/). Previously, I graduated from UC Irvine, majored in Computer Science and minored in Statistics. At UC Irvine, I worked closly with Prof. [Erik Sudderth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/) and Prof. [Wayne Hayes](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~wayne/).

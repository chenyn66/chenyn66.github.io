Hi! I'm Xiaoyin, welcome to my personal website.

Iâ€™m a first-year PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), advised by Prof. [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/).

Previously, I finished my Master's at Duke University, advised by Prof. [Sam Wiseman](https://swiseman.github.io/). I graduated from UC Irvine, majored in Computer Science and minored in Statistics. At UC Irvine, I worked closely with Prof. [Erik Sudderth](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sudderth/) and Prof. [Wayne Hayes](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~wayne/).
